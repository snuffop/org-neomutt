# Neomutt <-> org-mode

In Neomutt, send message links to org-mode.  From org-mode, open message links
in Neomutt.

See [my blog post]() for usage instructions.

This implementation is based on a [solution provided by Stefano
Zacchiroli](https://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/02/integrating_Mutt_with_Org-mode/).
